These programs are for me to explore Python async stuff
and to serve as reference for future async work.

The programs with names beginning with a number were inspired by
[Coroutines and Tasks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html).

The programs with names beginning with a single letter were inspired by
[Streams](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-stream.html).
